# Find the Figures

A Where's Wally clone created using MERN, where it consists of four levels, each level more difficult. There are three figures to find in each level, with the attempt being timed.

The Backend stores the image locations, figure names and the best times.

The Backend code can be accessed here: https://github.com/asnhck12/find-the-figures-backend

The Live App can be accessed here: https://find-the-figures.vercel.app/
